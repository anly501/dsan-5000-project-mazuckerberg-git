The Global Lithium Production dataset was extracted from the Our World in Data website. The Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy analyzes data on world energy markets from the previous year, and Our World in Data consolidates data originally derived from the reports produced. The dataset provides information on global lithium production, including data for major producing countries and aggregations at the regional, continental, and global levels. Lithium production is measured in metric tons. The dataset covers the period from 1995 to 2022.



While the dataset includes global data, this analysis will focus specifically on the evolution of lithium production, with a strong emphasis on the U.S. This approach allows for a more in-depth analysis of the growth and fluctuations of this resource, while assessing the impact on the economy.

[QUANTMOD API | R](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/quantmod)

The Chinese Yuan to U.S. Dollar spot exchange rate dataset is a critical component of the analysis. The lithium price is calculated globally in Chinese Yuan. Since the main focus of the analysis for this project is on the U.S., the information obtained from this dataset allows the original prices to be converted into U.S. dollars.

This currency conversion dataset was obtained from the Quantmod API, with the data originating from FRED economic data. The dataset provides daily exchange rates. The data source provides a wide range of dates for analysis, but the selection of the time period is determined by the information available for the other datasets and analysis variables.

### Global Lithium Demand Projection
[**Source**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/452025/projected-total-demand-for-lithium-globally/)

A key resource for our analysis is the Global Lithium Demand Projection dataset, which provides insight into the expected global demand for lithium. This data was originally published by the ComisiÃ³n Chilena del Cobre in June 2023 in the paper "El mercado de litio: Desarrollo reciente y proyecciones al 2035". Statista makes it available by condensing the the information into a dataset.

In recent years, the main source of lithium demand has come from electric vehicles. This is a trend that is expected to continue to grow progressively, so any projection of lithium demand will depend primarily on the growth of this sector. The demand projection methodology developed consists of several key steps. The first step is to obtain projected demand figures for electric vehicles. Second, it focuses on estimating the energy demand for lithium-ion batteries to be used in these vehicles. Third, the amount of lithium required for these batteries is calculated. Finally, this information is aggregated to present the projection of lithium demand specifically for electric vehicles, which is considered to be the most significant in the market. The information source for this analysis is Rho Motion, which was done in 2022.

This information is useful in two ways. On the one hand, it would be interesting to perform the same steps on raw data sets instead of using the analysis already done. On the other hand, this information serves as a key dataset for our assessment of future trends and the application of machine learning models.

<div class="clear-float">

![](./images/yahoo_finance.png){.right-align width="27%"}

::: {.justify}

Lithium-related companies play a key role in the performance of the industry. Using Yahoo Finance and other financial sources, we have compiled a dataset of market and financial information for the key companies in the industry. For this analysis, we focus on stock market data, income statements and balance sheets for the most recent dates available. 

This analysis will focus on 3 main production models; lithium production, electric vehicle production and lithium-ion batteries. We will look at Albemarle Corporation, Livent Corporation, Piedmont Lithium Inc. and Sigma Lithium Corporation. These companies are four of the most important companies in the world within the lithium production model. The first three companies were founded in the USA, while the last one was founded in Canada. Other major companies are located in Australia, Chile and China. The second model is electric vehicle production, and within this market we have well-known companies and some new ones. The six companies from the US that will be considered are Tesla, Inc, Ford Motor Company, ON Semiconductor Corp, Rivian Automotive, Inc, LiveWire Group Inc and AEHR Test Systems. The emerging market in this production model is China and in this case we will consider Li Auto Inc. and XPeng Inc. The third manufacturing companies we will analyze are BYD CO., LTD - China and Panasonic Holdings Corporation - Japan. Both companies are located in Asia and their main activity is lithium-ion batteries.

## Resources Prices

<div class="clear-float">

![](./images/IMF.png){.right-align width="17%"}

::: {.justify}

The International Monetary Fund is a useful resource with a variety of economic and market datasets, and for this project we will use it to collect data on the key resources needed to produce lithium-ion batteries. These include aluminum, cobalt, copper, nickel, zinc, and lithium. The emergence of mining operations for the different resources is a key aspect that drives the prices of each resource. By analyzing this data, we can be able to identify patterns and trends, correlations between resources, and compare how demand for each resource is driving prices. 

The composition of the lithium-ion battery depends on the manufacturer. In general terms, the lithium cells consist of a 5-20% of cobalt, 5-10% nickel, 15% aluminum, 10% copper, 5-10% lithium, 15% organic chemicals, and 7% of plastics. The composition also depends on the end use of the battery as it affects the performance and life of the battery.

## Electric Vehicles

<div class="clear-float">

![](./images/kaggle.png){.right-align width="25%"}

::: {.justify}
As the popularity of electric vehicles continues to grow, understanding their specifications becomes critical. Using a Kaggle dataset, we focus on key quantitative attributes that are essential for a comprehensive understanding of electric vehicle characteristics. The dataset includes details such as the vehicle make and model listed in *car name*. The most important quantitative characteristics are the capacity of the vehicle's battery, the energy efficiency rating, the fast-charging capability in minutes, the price of the vehicle in Germany, the driving range on a single charge, the maximum speed per hour, and the acceleration time from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour. The source of the information is listed in the *car name link*. The ability to analyze and compare these attributes enables both consumers and industry stakeholders to make informed decisions. This dataset facilitates research to understand which are the most influential factors and if there is a relationship between them.

## Lithium News

<div class="clear-float">

![](./images/news_api.png){.right-align width="26%"}

::: {.justify}
The Lithium News dataset is an essential resource for the project to understand the media perspective on the evolution of the lithium market. The News API allows the collection of text data from news articles related to lithium. This platform aggregates information from a variety of media sources. Given the focus of the project, the text data collection is primarily focused on U.S. media resources that have published articles in English. This approach ensures that the dataset provides relevant insights to address the project's questions.

The date range for the API is variable, depending on the amount of data available at the time the scraping is done. To optimize data collection and maximize the date range for article collection, a special function has been developed to adjust the number of days. This approach allows for the most current and broadest data collection.

<div class="clear-float">

![](./images/IBM_developer.png){.right-align width="30%"}

::: {.justify}
The Sentiment Analysis Dataset for the Lithium News is a crucial step in the analytical process of the project. It enriches the Lithium News dataset collected in the previous section. To improve our understanding of the lithium market perspective, we perform a sentiment analysis on the content of the news articles.

To do this, we will use the IBM Watson API, a tool designed to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The API allows us to process and analyze the text data and provide insights into the sentiment and tone of the articles.

The main objective of this analysis is to understand how the perspective on the lithium market has evolved. By evaluating the results obtained on the media news, we aim to determine whether the news articles have shown a bias towards a more positive or negative perspective. This allows us to identify potential shifts in sentiment that could impact the industry in the future.
