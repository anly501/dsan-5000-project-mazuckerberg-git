In this section, we examine the applicability of AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables (ARIMAX), Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables (SARIMAX), and Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) models. Considering the analysis performed and the models obtained in the previous section, we understand that additional analysis is needed to understand the relationship between two or more variables and their interaction among Time Series Forecasting models. Depending on the type of model being analyzed, we will take different steps to achieve the best forecasting model for the variables being analyzed.

## Oil Price ~ Oil Production

::: {.justify}

The two main variables that drive the analysis of the project are the global oil price and U.S. oil production. After doing some research, we understand that these two variables are influenced by each other.  In "The Impact of U.S. Supply Shocks on the Global Oil Price", Thomas S. @gundersen2020impact finds that between 2003 and 2015, 13% of the variation in the global oil price was due to U.S. supply shocks. 

In the section [VAR Model | Oil Price ~ Oil Production](https://mazuckerberg.georgetown.domains/DSAN_5600/7_ARIMAX/7_VAR_oil.html) is the analysis process and the forecast model elaborated with a detailed step by step and descriptions. Here we dive into the steps to find the best VAR model that fits out time series data. Below, we can observe the final model predictions. We can assume that the economic principle of law and demand is cleared shown in this case. High fluctuations in the amount of oil produced can lead to an excess in supply, therefore the prices go down.

## Inflation Rate ~ Oil Price + Oil Production

::: {.justify}
Extending our macroeconomic analysis, we decided to construct an ARIMAX model to predict the inflation rate, including oil price and oil production as exogenous variables. The main result of our analysis points to an imminent decline in the inflation rate. In addition, our results underscore the substantial relevance of both oil price and oil production as significant factors influencing the inflation rate. For the inflation rate variable we calculated the forecasts using an [ARIMAX Model ~ Oil Price + Oil Production](https://mazuckerberg.georgetown.domains/DSAN_5600/7_ARIMAX/7_inflation_rate.html)

## Bus Transport ~ Oil Price

::: {.justify}
Buses depend on fuel to operate and that fluctuations in oil prices affect the cost of primary fuel. One of the variables that will be analyzed within the transportation industry is bus passenger trips using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model with oil price as the exogenous variable.

We created a [SARIMAX Model | Bus Passengers](https://mazuckerberg.georgetown.domains/DSAN_5600/7_ARIMAX/7_bus_passengers_PC.html) with Oil Price as an exogenous variable. The plot below shows the forecast calculated using the model SARIMAX(1,0,2)(1,1,1)[12] model.
This analysis was done using the data from the Pre-COVID analysis done in the Exploratory Data Analysis for technical purposes. The use of the complete data wasn't possible because the final model obtained was too complex to execute.

## Bicycles Transport ~ Oil Price

::: {.justify}
Bicycles have gained significant popularity in recent years, in line with a broader shift toward more sustainable practices. In the section [ARIMAX Model | Bicycles Transportation](https://mazuckerberg.georgetown.domains/DSAN_5600/7_ARIMAX/7_bicycles.html), we focus on assessing the impact of oil prices on bicycle consumption expenditures. The projections generated by the ARIMA(3,1,3) model are presented below. Despite a previous upward trend, the projections indicate that levels will remain relatively constant with less variation. This stability is particularly beneficial given the significant consumer spending in this sector in the current scenario.

## Air Transport ~ Oil Price

::: {.justify}
Continuing our investigation of transportation variables, our focus shifts to consumer spending on air transportation. Using an ARIMA(2,1,2) model, we have obtained predicted values. A close examination of the results reveals a consistent pattern with no discernible trend. The analysis details can be found in the section [ARIMAX Model | Air Transport](https://mazuckerberg.georgetown.domains/DSAN_5600/7_ARIMAX/7_air_transport.html).Subsequent analyses could potentially benefit from the inclusion of additional relevant variables to refine the predictive capabilities.
