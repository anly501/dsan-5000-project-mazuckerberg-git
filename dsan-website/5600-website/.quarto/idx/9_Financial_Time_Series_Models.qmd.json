These models are commonly used in finance to capture changing volatility over time in a time series. \n\nFor each analysis, we will model and predict the volatility of future returns. Volatility is a measure of the dispersion of returns on a given market index. We will evaluate the application of the models by analyzing stationarity and volatility by using ACF plots and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test. We apply decomposition and differencing methods to make the data stationary when necessary. Where appropriate, we evaluate the model parameters and  auto.arima() results using model diagnostics to obtain the best ARIMA model. The model residuals are plotted using ACF and PACF to determine the possible parameters for ARCH and GARCH models. Once the best model is obtained, the forecast is plotted.\n\nTo assess the impact of oil price and production fluctuations on the manufacturing sector, we will use food production and the healthcare index.\n:::\n\nBelow are the libraries used in this section:\n``` {r}\n#| echo: true\n#| message: false\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Libraries\"\n#| results: 'hide'\n#| warning: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(forecast)\nlibrary(astsa)\nlibrary(xts)\nlibrary(tseries)\nlibrary(fpp2)\nlibrary(fma)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(TSstudio)\nlibrary(quantmod)\nlibrary(tidyquant)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(imputeTS)\nlibrary(zoo)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(vars)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(fGarch)\n```\n\n\n\n::: {.justify}\nOur examination of the food industry data revealed that the oil price variable is not significant in the context of the linear model.
