Considering the analysis performed and the models obtained in the previous section, we understand that additional analysis is needed to understand the relationship between two or more variables and their interaction among Time Series Forecasting models.

After doing some research, we understand that these two variables are influenced by each other.  In \"The Impact of U.S. Supply Shocks on the Global Oil Price\", Thomas S. @gundersen2020impact finds that between 2003 and 2015, 13% of the variation in the global oil price was due to U.S. supply shocks. \n\nIn the section [VAR Model | Oil Price ~ Oil Production](https://mazuckerberg.georgetown.domains/DSAN_5600/7_ARIMAX/7_VAR_oil.html) is the analysis process and the forecast model elaborated with a detailed step by step and descriptions. Here we dive into the steps to find the best VAR model that fits out time series data. Below, we can observe the final model predictions. We can assume that the economic principle of law and demand is cleared shown in this case. High fluctuations in the amount of oil produced can lead to an excess in supply, therefore the prices go down.\n:::\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./images/7_VAR_oil.png\" width=90% height=70%>\n</p>\n\n\n</div>\n<div id=\"tab2\" class=\"tab-content-model-selection\">\n\n## Inflation Rate ~ Oil Price + Oil Production\n\n::: {.justify}\nExtending our macroeconomic analysis, we decided to construct an ARIMAX model to predict the inflation rate, including oil price and oil production as exogenous variables.
