Since there are currently no substitutes available in sufficient quantities, their price is a determining factor in the cost structure of the final products. Therefore, any significant change in price has a direct impact on the real economy. This forces governments to make decisions to mitigate potential negative effects by adjusting public economic policies.\n\nThe cost dynamics of both the pharmaceutical and food industries are significantly impacted by oil prices, affecting various facets of their operations.\nFluctuations in oil prices affect the cost of raw materials, particularly chemicals and plastics used in packaging, which can increase companies' production costs as oil prices rise. In addition, higher oil prices contribute to increased transportation costs for shipping both raw materials and finished products, affecting the overall cost structure of the supply chain. Given the energy-intensive nature of pharmaceutical manufacturing, changes in oil prices can affect energy costs, thereby impacting operational expenses and potentially lead to higher production costs. Moreover, high oil prices can increase fuel costs, influencing consumers' disposable income and, consequently, their spending patterns on food and pharmaceutical products. The complex relationship between oil prices and these industries is further shaped by factors such as geographic location, supply chain strategies and the nature of the product within the broader context of the interconnected global economy.\n\nHigher oil prices increase production costs for businesses, potentially reducing their profit margins. This can lead to reduced business investment, particularly in energy-intensive industries.\n\nAs oil prices rise, consumers may reduce their spending on other goods and services due to higher energy costs. Consumer confidence may also be adversely affected, thereby affecting spending patterns.\n\nRising oil prices may encourage investment in the energy sector, including exploration and production. Conversely, falling oil prices may lead to reduced investment in the energy sector, affecting employment and economic activity in related industries.\n:::\n\n### Big Picture Chart:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./images/Time Series Big Picture.png\" width=100% height=80%>\n</p>\n\n\n## Literature Review\n::: {.justify}\nA clear example of a voluntary decision is when OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) decides to reduce the volume of production with the intention of causing an increase in the price of oil and its derivatives.\n\nA geopolitical event, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where a unilateral decision by Russia not to supply oil and gas to the member countries of the European Union, creates a potential shortage, causing the price of oil to rise.\n\nThe current situation continues to put inflationary pressure on the US economy, forcing the government to monitor the inflation rate, continue the process of raising the interest rates, in order to strengthen its currency and make oil imports cheaper.
