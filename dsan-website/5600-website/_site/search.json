    "text": "By: Maria Agustina Zuckerberg\n\n\nWhat is a Time Series ?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular timestamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes."

    "text": "Big Picture\nPetroleum and its derivatives are an essential raw material in almost every manufacturing process. Since there are currently no substitutes available in sufficient quantities, their price is a determining factor in the cost structure of the final products. Therefore, any significant change in price has a direct impact on the real economy. This forces governments to make decisions to mitigate potential negative effects by adjusting public economic policies.\nWhen oil prices rise, consumers may reduce their spending on other goods and services due to higher energy costs. Consumer confidence may also be adversely affected, thereby affecting spending patterns.\nHigher oil prices increase production costs for businesses, potentially reducing their profit margins. This may lead to reduced business investment, particularly in energy-intensive industries.\nRising oil prices may encourage investment in the energy sector, including exploration and production. Conversely, falling oil prices may lead to reduced investment in the energy sector, affecting employment and economic activity in related industries.\nBig Picture Chart:"

    "text": "Literature Review\nA clear example of a voluntary decision is when OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) decides to reduce the volume of production with the intention of causing an increase in the price of oil and its derivatives.\nA geopolitical event, such as Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, where a unilateral decision by Russia not to supply oil and gas to the member countries of the European Union, creates a potential shortage, causing the price of oil to rise.\nThe current situation continues to put inflationary pressure on the US economy, forcing the government to monitor the inflation rate, continue the process of raising the interest rates, in order to strengthen its currency and make oil imports cheaper. In this context, the U.S. and the European Union are obliged to accelerate the process of replacing the use of fossil fuels with renewable, environmentally friendly energy, thus generating less dependence on oil."
